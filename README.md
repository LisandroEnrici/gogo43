# Gogo43 site

This project aims to enhance the business's image by giving it a fresh, modern look and introducing it to the online environment. Additionally, it seeks to upgrade the way clients interact with the menu.

For the sake of simplicity and cost-effectiveness, it has been decided to create a static front-end app. This decision may change in the future if the business chooses to do so.
